# Information and consent form

## Expert survey: Where are suitable high-alpine areas for ground-mounted solar energy systems within Switzerland accounting for their impact on ecosystem services?

Due to your expertise in solar energy systems and/or at least one of the ecosystem services, we would like to ask you if you are willing to participate in our study with the overall title **“Spatial Suitability for PV Infrastructure in Switzerland”**. Therefore, we are asking you to fill out the following online questionnaire that especially addresses the question:  
**How do ground-mounted solar energy systems affect ecosystem services in high-alpine regions in Switzerland?**

Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary. You may choose to withdraw from the survey at any time without any consequences. There are no foreseeable risks associated with participating in this project. While there are no direct benefits to you, your participation will help to improve the understanding of the potential ecosystem services impacts of solar energy systems, which later will be translated into a statistical model (Bayesian network) informing about the robustness and suitability of locations for solar energy systems.  
This project is part of the course **Participatory Environmental Modelling** at ETH Zurich.

Your responses will be strictly confidential. Your information will be encrypted and securely stored. Identifying data will be deleted and all other data anonymised as soon as the purpose of the data processing allows this (cf. ETH Law Art. 36d). The data from this research will be reported only in aggregated form, ensuring that individual participants cannot be identified. The data collected will be used for academic purposes, i.e., scientific publication. It will not be shared with third parties.  
This survey is in alignment with the Federal Data Protection Act (FADP) and European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Members of the ETH Zurich Ethics Commission may access the original data for examination purposes. Strict confidentiality will be observed at any time.  
This study was examined by the ETH Zurich Ethics Commission as proposal **25 ETHICS-115**.  
The secretariat of the ETH Zurich Ethics Committee is available to help you with complaints in connection with your participation.

Thank you for your time and participation!
