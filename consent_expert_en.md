## Expert Survey:
**Where are suitable high-alpine areas for ground-mounted solar energy systems within Switzerland accounting for their impact on ecosystem services?**

Because of your expertise in solar energy systems and/or at least one of the ecosystem services, we would like to ask you if you are willing to participate in our study titled:

**‚ÄúSpatial Suitability for PV Infrastructure in Switzerland‚Äù**

We ask you to fill out the following online questionnaire which especially addresses the question:  
**How do ground-mounted solar energy systems affect ecosystem services in high-alpine regions in Switzerland?**
