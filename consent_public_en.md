# Information and consent form

## Survey: Where are suitable high-alpine areas for ground-mounted solar energy systems within Switzerland accounting for their impact on ecosystem services?

We, students at ETH Zurich, are conducting a study to understand where it might be suitable to install solar energy systems in high-alpine areas of Switzerland, and how these systems might affect the environment.

We would like to hear your opinion. You don’t need to be an expert – this survey is for anyone interested in nature, energy or the future of our mountains. Your answer will help us understand how people think solar energy might impact things like water, plants, animals, and recreation in high-alpine areas. Just fill out a short online questionnaire. It will take about **5 minutes** of your time. There are no right or wrong answers – we’re just interested in your views.

Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary. You can stop at any time and don’t have to answer any questions you don’t want to. There are no risks to you, and while you won’t receive any personal benefit, your input will help guide future energy and environmental planning.

Your responses will be strictly confidential. Your information will be encrypted and securely stored. Identifying data will be deleted and all other data anonymised as soon as the purpose of the data processing allows this (cf. ETH Law Art. 36d). The data from this research will be reported only in aggregated form, ensuring that individual participants cannot be identified. The data collected will be used for academic purposes, i.e., scientific publication. It will not be shared with third parties. This survey is in alignment with the Federal Data Protection Act (FADP) and European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Members of the ETH Zurich Ethics Commission may access the original data for examination purposes. Strict confidentiality will be observed at any time. This study was examined by the ETH Zurich Ethics Commission as proposal **25 ETHICS-115**. The secretariat of the ETH Zurich Ethics Committee is available to help you with complaints in connection with your participation.

Thank you for your time and participation!
